Prediction Model for the English Premier League Season 2023-2024

Created a Prediction Model to predict results of every match for the English Premier League Season 2023-2024 with Historical Data used from 2000-2001 Season to 2022-2023 Season.

Regression Models Used.
1. Poisson Regression model used to predict features such as Full time Goals Scored, Shots On Target, Half time Goals Scored, etc basically all the statistically which will not be available to us before the match is played but is important to the result of the match.
2. Random Forrest Regressor used to predict the match result i.e. FTR (Full time Result)

Features That were important to the Random Forrest Regressor Model.
